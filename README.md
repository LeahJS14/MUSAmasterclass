## Penn MUSA Masterclass 2020

__Using Mapbox for Spatial Data Science in R__

This repository contains materials for the 2020 Masterclass workshop presented by Kyle Walker for the University of Pennsylvania's Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program.  

To run the examples from the workshop yourself, clone the repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walkerke/MUSAmasterclass.git 
```

Open the project in RStudio and navigate to the `tutorial` folder, then open the `index.Rmd` document.  The examples in that document will run correctly if code chunks are set to be evaluated in that directory.
